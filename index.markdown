## [Reinforced Genetic Algorithm Learning for Optimizing Computation Graphs, ICLR 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02494.pdf)

Using Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning, we are able to propose 
good mutant sampling beta distributions to a genetic algorithm.

We use this genetic algorithm to optimize the placement and scheduling decisions
of TensorFlow computation graphs in multi-device settings and discover that our 
algorithm can reduce the running time by upto 20% and peak RAM consumption by 
upto 50%.

## [Graph Reresentations for Higher Order Logic and Theorem Proving, AAAI 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10006.pdf)

We show that representing s-expressions as graphs and encoding them with Graph
Neural Networks achieves state-of-the-art performance for automated theorem 
proving on the HOList benchmark.

There are several non-trivial ways to represent an s-expression as a graph and
some of them are clearly better than others.

## [Zero-Shot Learning for Fast Optimization of Computation Graphs, NeurIPS  2019](http://mlforsystems.org/assets/papers/neurips2019/zero_shot_paliwal_2019.pdf)

A short version of our ICLR paper, I presented this at the [ML for Systems](http://mlforsystems.org)
 Workshop at Vancouver in December 2019.
